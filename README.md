##  Topics:
* What is statistical learning?
* Types of models: regression, classification, unsupervised
* Model estimation: numerical optimization
* Model assessment and selection: predictive accuracy
* Resampling methods: bootstrap, permutation, cross-validation, bagging
* Regression: splines, additive models, ridge regression, variable selection, lasso
* High dimension, low sample size: principal components, partial least squares, regularization
* Supervised classification: logistic regression, neural networks, trees, forests, support vector machines, ensembles
* Unsupervised classification: hierarchical clustering, k-means, self-organizing maps, model-based clustering
* Cleaning, exploring and visualizing data

## Software:
* R 
* Weka
      
## Approach to teaching R? Use Rmarkdown lecture notes like http://dicook.github.io/stat585/, and this should help students get comfortable with R themselves. (Ignore the ugly web site design!)
